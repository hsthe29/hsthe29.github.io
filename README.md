# STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS
# Project Doraemon
**@author: hsthe29**

The project provides a website to read Doraemon stories. It comes from my hobby of reading Doraemon (and many other series).

Structure:
- Frontend: HTML + CSS + Js
- Backend: Google Drive, Google Sheets, Google Apps Script
- Host: GitHub Pages

# Update:
- Short stories: 20 volumes are available.
- Long stories: 1 volume is available.

I'll continue to update other volumes.
